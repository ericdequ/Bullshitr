To set up the project with Expo, follow these steps:

1. Install Expo CLI globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. Initialize a new Expo project: `expo init Bullshitr`
3. Choose the "blank" template when prompted.
4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Bullshitr`
5. Create the necessary directories and files as outlined in the file structure above.
6. Implement the components, screens, and services according to the app's requirements.
7. Set up the app navigation using the desired navigation library (e.g., React Navigation).
8. Test the app using Expo's development server: `expo start`
9. Follow the Expo CLI instructions to run the app on an emulator/simulator or physical device.

Remember to integrate with a suitable AI analysis engine or API for processing the recorded conversations and providing insights. You may also need to handle user authentication and data storage securely.

Refer to the Expo documentation and best practices for building and deploying your app, and ensure that you adhere to privacy and data protection regulations when handling user conversations and data.
